# Go Meter Parsing

This repository adds support for parsing of different signed meter formats used for Mess- und Eichrechts- compatibility. 
Currently supported formats are:
- OCMF
- Mennekes (Not EDL40)
- PCDF (Porsche)
- Alfen

Additionally you can wrap those formats into a format readable by https://github.com/SAFE-eV/transparenzsoftware.
